"Typography is to literature as musical performance is to composition: an essential act of inter-
pretation, full of endless opportunities for insight or obtuseness. Much typography is far removed from literature, for language has many uses, including packaging and propaganda. Like music,
it can be used to manipulate behaviour and emotions. But this is not where typographers, musi-
cians or other human beings show us their finest side. Typography at its best is a slow performing art, worthy of the same informed appreciation that we sometimes give to musical performances,
and capable of giving similar nourishment and pleasure in return."
[Robert Bringhurst, The Elements of Typographic Style]
